# Keeping My Managers Updated While Saving Time
As a sales engineer, I'm just as accountable for opportunities as my sales counterparts are (AEs, AMs). And its also top of mind for my managers. Managers need to be in the loop not just during those account/forecast syncs, but really all the time from my experience. To help reduce the friction between keeping my managers up to date and saving time, I've set up an automated bot that updates my managers weekly on Mondays with a high-level overview of 1) Where we are now, 2) Next Steps and 3) Current Forecast for each of my opportunities.

I created a mini CRM for my opportunities using [Google Tables](https://tables.area120.google.com/) (its free). See the screenshots below. You'll also find my format for updates in the "Where are we now?" column.

I don't share my table with my team or manager since each of us track our updates differently, but by using a bot I can share just whats important and top of mind i.e. Where we are now. To set the bot up, simply choose "Bots" on the right hand side of the tool bar and choose/fill in the appropriate details. See the screenshot below to see how I've configured my bot. You could set something similar up using Salesforce, or whatever your company's preferred tooling is, but if your company doesn't have one (or has a bunch) then Tables is a fantastic solution for this problem.
