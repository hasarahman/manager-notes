# notes
As a sales engineer, I'm just as accountable for opportunities as my sales counterparts are (AEs, AMs). And its also top of mind for my managers. They need to be in the loop not just during those weekly account/forecast syncs, but really all the time from my experience. To help reduce the friction between keeping my managers up to date and saving time, I've set up an automated bot that updates my managers weekly on Mondays with a high-level overview of 1) Where we are now, 2) Next Steps and 3) Current Forecast for each of my opportunities.

I created a mini CRM for my opportunities using [Google Tables]([url](https://tables.area120.google.com/)https://tables.area120.google.com/) (its free).
